## ✅ Checklist
### 1. Consent Management — Section 6, DPDP Act 2023
Consent is the cornerstone of lawful data processing under the DPDP Act. All five conditions must be met simultaneously.
- [ ] Consent is **free, specific, informed, unconditional, and unambiguous** (Section 6)

### 7. Legitimate Uses (Processing Without Consent) — Section 7, DPDP Act 2023

- [ ] Appropriate safeguards are in place for any cross-border data flows
### 9. Exemptions — Section 17, DPDP Act 2023

- [ ] Non-exempt data processing continues to fully comply with all other sections
### 10. Consent Manager Integration — Section 2(f), DPDP Rules 2025
Consent Managers are entities registered with the DPBI that help Data Principals manage their consent across Data Fiduciaries.

- [ ] If using a Consent Manager, ensure they are **registered with the DPBI** and meet the eligibility criteria (net worth ≥ ₹2 crore, incorporated in India)
