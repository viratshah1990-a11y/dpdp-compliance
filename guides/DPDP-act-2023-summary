## Key Definitions — Section 2
Before diving into obligations, here are the terms the Act uses:
| DPDP Term | Who or What | Closest GDPR Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Principal** | The individual whose personal data is processed — your customer, user, employee | Data Subject |
| **Data Fiduciary** | The entity that decides *why* and *how* to process data — your company | Data Controller |
| **Data Processor** | A third party that processes data on the Fiduciary's behalf — your cloud/analytics vendor | Data Processor |
| **Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF)** | A Data Fiduciary designated by the government due to high volume, sensitivity, or risk | No direct equivalent |
| **Consent Manager** | A registered intermediary that helps individuals manage consent across multiple Fiduciaries | No direct equivalent |
| **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)** | The quasi-judicial body that investigates complaints and imposes penalties | Supervisory Authority (DPA) |
---
## Section 3 — Who Does the Act Apply To?
**It applies to:**
- Digital personal data processed **within India** (whether collected online or digitised from offline sources)
- Digital personal data processed **outside India** if related to offering goods or services to individuals in India
**It does NOT apply to:**
- Personal data processed by an individual for purely **personal or domestic purposes**
- Personal data made **publicly available** by the Data Principal or under any law
**ComplyZero note:** If you operate a website or app accessible from India and collect any user data (even just an email address), the Act applies to you.
---
## Section 4 — Lawful Basis for Processing
Personal data may only be processed for a **lawful purpose** under one of two bases:
1. **Consent** (Section 6)
2. **Legitimate Uses** (Section 7) — specific, limited circumstances where consent is not required
Unlike GDPR, there is **no general "legitimate interest" basis** under DPDP. You must fit within Section 7's specific categories or obtain consent.
---
## Section 5 — Notice to Data Principal
Before collecting personal data (or as soon as reasonably practicable for data already held), you must give a clear notice containing:
1. **What** personal data is being collected
2. **Why** — the specific purpose of processing
3. **How** the individual can exercise their rights (access, correction, erasure, nomination)
4. **How** to lodge a grievance with you
5. **How** to complain to the DPBI
The notice must be in **plain language** — understandable on its own — and must be available in **English plus all 22 languages** listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.
**ComplyZero note:** The 22-language requirement is one of the most operationally demanding provisions in the Act. ComplyZero's platform generates compliant notices in all required languages automatically.
---
## Section 6 — Consent
Consent under DPDP must satisfy **all five** conditions simultaneously:
| Condition | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Free** | Not coerced, bundled with unrelated services, or made a precondition |
| **Specific** | Tied to a clearly stated purpose — no blanket consents |
| **Informed** | The Data Principal understands what they are agreeing to (via the Section 5 notice) |
| **Unconditional** | No conditions beyond the stated processing purpose |
| **Unambiguous** | Demonstrated through a clear affirmative action — no pre-ticked boxes, no silence-as-consent |
**Key rules:**
- Consent can be **withdrawn at any time**, and withdrawal must be **as easy as giving consent** (Section 6(6))
- Upon withdrawal, the Fiduciary must **stop processing and erase** the data, unless legally required to retain it (Section 6(7))
- Consent must be **verifiable** — you need records showing when, how, and for what purpose consent was obtained
---
## Section 7 — Legitimate Uses (When You Don't Need Consent)
The Act lists **specific situations** where processing is permitted without obtaining consent:
| Ground | Plain-English Meaning |
|---|---|
| **(a)** Voluntary provision | The individual voluntarily gives you data for a specific purpose and doesn't object to processing |
| **(b)** State functions | Government processing for subsidies, benefits, licences, services, or permits |
| **(c)** Court compliance | Processing required by a court judgment, order, or decree |
| **(d)** Medical emergency | Responding to a threat to the life or immediate health of an individual |
| **(e)** Disaster response | Measures during natural disasters, epidemics, or threats to public order |
| **(f)** Employment | Processing for recruitment, attendance tracking, performance assessment, termination, or related HR functions |
**This list is exhaustive.** You cannot invent a new "legitimate use" category. If your processing does not fit one of these, you need consent.
**ComplyZero note:** Section 7(a) — "voluntary provision" — is the most commonly misunderstood ground. It does not mean "the user filled out a form, so we have consent." The user must have voluntarily provided the data *and* not raised any objection to processing for the specific purpose. ComplyZero's consent module helps you document and track which lawful basis applies to each processing activity.

## Section 8 — Core Obligations of a Data Fiduciary
This is the most substantial section for businesses. Every Data Fiduciary must:
### 8(1) — Accountability
You are responsible for compliance, **even if processing is carried out by a Data Processor** on your behalf. You cannot outsource accountability.
### 8(2) — Data Processor Contracts
Any Data Processor relationship must be governed by a **valid contract** that specifies the scope and purpose of processing.
### 8(3) — Data Quality
Make **reasonable efforts** to keep personal data accurate, complete, and consistent — especially if it will be used for decisions about the Data Principal or shared with another Fiduciary.
### 8(4) — Purpose and Collection Limitation
Collect only the data you actually need and process it only for the purpose stated in your notice.
### 8(5) — Security Safeguards
Implement **appropriate technical and organisational measures** to protect personal data. The DPDP Rules 2025 specify:
- Encryption
- Access controls
- Data masking and tokenisation
- Continuous monitoring and logging
- Backup and recovery systems
- **Security logs retained for at least 1 year**
**Penalty for failure:** Up to **₹250 crore**.
### 8(6) — Breach Notification
If a personal data breach occurs:
- Notify the **DPBI within 72 hours**
- Notify **affected Data Principals** without unreasonable delay
- Also notify **CERT-In within 6 hours** (under the CERT-In Directions 2022 — a parallel obligation)
**Penalty for failure:** Up to **₹200 crore**.
### 8(7) — Erasure
Erase personal data when:
- The purpose for which it was collected is no longer being served, **OR**
- The Data Principal withdraws consent
...whichever comes **first**. Exception: retention required by another law in force.
The DPDP Rules 2025 add:
- Send a **48-hour pre-erasure notice** to the Data Principal before automated erasure
- Maintain **erasure records** with documented reasons for any rejected requests
- Retain erasure logs for at least **1 year**
### 8(8) — Published Contact
Publicly disclose the contact details of your **Data Protection Officer** (if you're an SDF) or a **designated point of contact** on your website.
---
## Section 9 — Children's Data
The DPDP Act defines a **child as anyone under 18** — stricter than GDPR (16) or COPPA (13).
**Requirements:**
- Obtain **verifiable parental or legal guardian consent** before any processing
- **No behavioural tracking** of children
- **No targeted advertising** directed at children
- **No processing detrimental** to a child's well-being
The Central Government may grant exemptions for specific Fiduciaries if processing is "verifiably safe," but no such exemptions have been notified yet.
**Penalty for children's data violations:** Up to **₹200 crore**.
---
## Section 10 — Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF) Obligations
The government may designate certain Fiduciaries as "Significant" based on volume of data processed, sensitivity, risk of harm, and potential impact on sovereignty or elections.
SDFs must additionally:
| Obligation | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Data Protection Officer** | Appoint a DPO who is based in India and represents the SDF before the DPBI |
| **Independent Data Auditor** | Appoint an auditor to conduct compliance assessments |
| **Data Protection Impact Assessment** | Conduct a DPIA before any processing that poses significant risk |
| **Periodic Audits** | Conduct regular compliance audits and publish findings as required |
**Penalty for SDF non-compliance:** Up to **₹150 crore**.
---
## Sections 11–14 — Data Principal Rights
The Act grants four rights to every individual whose data you process:
### Section 11 — Right to Access
The Data Principal can request a **summary of personal data** being processed and the processing activities undertaken.
### Section 12 — Right to Correction and Erasure
The individual can request:
- **Correction** of inaccurate or misleading data
- **Completion** of incomplete data
- **Erasure** of data that is no longer necessary
### Section 13 — Right to Grievance Redressal
You must provide an **accessible mechanism** for individuals to lodge complaints. Grievances must be acknowledged and resolved within the timelines specified in the DPDP Rules 2025. If unresolved, the individual can escalate to the DPBI.
### Section 14 — Right to Nominate
A Data Principal can **nominate another person** to exercise their rights in case of death or incapacity. This is unique to DPDP — GDPR has no equivalent.
---
## Section 15 — Duties of Data Principals
Unusually, the Act also imposes duties on individuals:
- Do not file **false or frivolous complaints**
- Do not provide **false personal data**
- Do not **suppress material information**
- Do not **impersonate** another person when providing data
- Do not register a false grievance or complaint
**Penalty:** Up to ₹10,000.
---
## Section 16 — Cross-Border Data Transfer
Personal data can be transferred outside India **except to countries specifically restricted** by government notification. This is a **blacklist model** — the opposite of GDPR's whitelist approach.
As of February 2026, no countries have been restricted. Businesses should monitor government notifications for updates.
---
## Section 17 — Exemptions
The Act carves out **10 categories** of exempt processing:
1. National security and sovereignty
2. Public order
3. Prevention, detection, or investigation of offences
4. Enforcement of legal rights in court
5. Processing by courts, tribunals, or regulatory bodies
6. Publicly available personal data
7. Research, archiving, or statistical purposes (with conditions)
8. Processing by notified startups (criteria TBD)
9. Mergers, acquisitions, and corporate restructuring
10. Processing related to credit scoring (as prescribed)
Exemptions are **specific and conditional.** They do not give blanket immunity — only the provisions explicitly listed are exempted.
---
## Section 18 — Data Protection Board of India
The DPBI is the enforcement body. Key facts:
- **Quasi-judicial** — it investigates, adjudicates, and imposes penalties
- Has **powers of a civil court** for investigations
- Can issue **corrective orders** — stop processing, delete data, improve safeguards
- Appeals go to **TDSAT** (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal), then to the **Supreme Court**
---
